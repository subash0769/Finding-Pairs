Finding Pairs Project

What this project does

This Java program asks you to enter a list of numbers (like [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]) and a target number. It then finds and shows any pair of numbers from the list that add up to the target. If thereâ€™s no such pair, it tells you that.

How to run it

Just run the program and follow the prompts to enter the list and target number.
